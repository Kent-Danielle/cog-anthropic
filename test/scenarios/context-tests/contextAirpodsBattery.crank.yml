scenario: Airpods battery life context inquiry
description: >
  Provide battery life context for the Airpods Pro 2 and the original Airpods Pro to test the models' ability to differentiate which is better

tokens:
  test:
    prompt: If I tell you that the Airpods Pro 2 has a 6 hour battery life compared to the original Airpods Pro's 4.5 hours, can you tell me which one has a better battery life?
    modela: gpt-4-0613
    modelb: gpt-4-1106-preview
    modelc: gpt-4-0125-preview
    semanticSimilariityExpectation: The new AirPods Pro 2 get a better battery life offering up to 6 hours compared to the original AirPods Pro's 4 and a half hours.
    semanticSimilariityOperator: be greater than
