scenario: Best sorting algorithm inquiry
description: >
  Test the models' ability to choose the most time efficient algorithm out of a set of sorting algorithms

tokens:
  test:
    prompt: Which of the following algorithms is the most time efficient in the worst case, for sorting a list of numbers?
            A Bubble sort
            B Quick sort
            C Merge sort
            D Insertion sort
            E Selection sort
    modela: gpt-4-0613
    modelb: gpt-4-1106-preview
    modelc: gpt-4-0125-preview
    equalsExpectation: C | Merge sort
    equalsOperator: match

steps:
- step: OpenAI model {{test.modela}} response to "{{test.prompt}}" should {{test.equalsOperator}} {{test.equalsExpectation}}
  data:
    __StepOrder: 1
- step: OpenAI model {{test.modelb}} response to "{{test.prompt}}" should {{test.equalsOperator}} {{test.equalsExpectation}}
  data:
    __StepOrder: 2
- step: OpenAI model {{test.modelc}} response to "{{test.prompt}}" should {{test.equalsOperator}} {{test.equalsExpectation}}
  data:
    __StepOrder: 3
